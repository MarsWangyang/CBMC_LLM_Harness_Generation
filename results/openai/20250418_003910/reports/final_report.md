## RAG Knowledge Base Statistics
Code functions stored: 0
Pattern templates: 16
Error patterns stored: 0
Successful solutions: 0

The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) knowledge base stores code functions, patterns, errors, and solutions to improve harness generation over time. Each run contributes to this knowledge base, helping future runs generate better harnesses with fewer iterations.
